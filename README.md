 **Project Structure**: The project consists of two main folders: `frontend` and `backend`.

 **Installation and Running**:
   - For Backend:
     - Open the terminal
     - Navigate to the `backend` folder (`cd backend`).
     - Install backend requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
     - Run migrations with `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`.
     - Start the Django server with `python manage.py runserver`.

   - For Frontend:
     - Open new terminal (do not close the previous one)
     - If not in the main folder, navigate back (`cd ..`).
     - Go to the `frontend` folder (`cd frontend`).
     - Install frontend dependencies with `npm install`.
     - Start the React development server with `npm start`.
